### ðŸ“° Dataset

This project uses the **"Fake and Real News Dataset"** available on Kaggle. The dataset is divided into two CSV files, which are loaded and combined for analysis:

* `Fake.csv`: Contains news articles labeled as fake.
* `True.csv`: Contains news articles labeled as real.

**Note:** The raw data files are not included in this repository due to their size. You can download them directly from the original source.
